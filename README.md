# Tasks Overview

âœ… Task 1: Decision Tree Classifier (Iris Dataset)
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using the popular Iris flower dataset.

- Uses `scikit-learn` for model implementation.
- Includes data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Provides visualizations of the decision tree.
- Outputs accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

---

âœ… Task 2: Sentiment Analysis
Performs binary sentiment analysis on a custom dataset of product reviews.

- Text preprocessing using regular expressions.
- TF-IDF vectorization of text data.
- Sentiment classification using Logistic Regression.
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

âœ… Task 3: CNN for Image Classification
This notebook implements a CNN for classifying images into different categories.

- Uses TensorFlow/Keras for building the model.
- Data augmentation and preprocessing using `ImageDataGenerator`.
- Training, validation, and testing on directory-based image datasets.
- Outputs model evaluation metrics and confusion matrix.

---

âœ… Task 4: Recommendation System
A deep learning-based collaborative filtering recommendation system.

- Utilizes TensorFlow to create user and item embeddings.
- Processes user-movie ratings and encodes them numerically.
- Splits data into training and testing sets.
- Trains a neural network to predict user ratings
